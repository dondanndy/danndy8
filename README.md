This is a little project just for educational purposes, pretty much like 99% of others CHIP8 emulators out there.

CPU and GPU are completely implemented and functional, passing all tests.

Please, as of right now place your ROMS on the folder called ```ROMS``` (which already has some of them), from which the emulator will ask you choose the one you want to run.

## Libraries

This project uses [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) to present graphics and get controls. In Windows, my recommendation is to use [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html), but there is also the option of doing it manually.
